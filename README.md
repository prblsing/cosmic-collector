# Cosmic Collector

**Cosmic Collector** is a fast-paced, arcade-style space game where you pilot a spaceship through a cosmic field and collect glowing energy orbs within a 30-second time limit. The game tests your reflexes, precision, and strategy as you aim to maximize your score by gathering as many energy orbs as possible before the clock runs out.

## Game Features

### Objective
Your mission is to collect as many glowing energy orbs as you can within 30 seconds. Each orb you collect increases your energy score, with larger orbs giving you more points. The goal is to maximize your score while racing against the timer.

### Scoring System
- **Orbs**: Collecting small orbs gives you fewer points, while larger orbs provide more energy and a higher score.
- **Speed Bonus**: You can use a special key to boost your ship’s speed, allowing you to gather more orbs in less time. However, moving faster also makes control more difficult, adding a layer of challenge and strategy.

### Controls
- **Arrow Keys**: Use the arrow keys to navigate your ship in all directions.
- **Boost**: Hold the **Shift** key to increase your ship’s speed and cover more ground. But be careful—speeding up makes it harder to control your ship, so balance between speed and precision is key!

### Enter Player Name
At the start of the game, you’ll be prompted to enter your name. This adds a personal touch to your gaming experience, and your name will be displayed along with your final score at the end of each session.

### Top 5 Scores
After each game, your score will be compared to the top 5 highest scores. If you rank among the top 5, your name and score will be displayed on the leaderboard. This feature adds a competitive edge to the game, encouraging players to aim for the best score.

## How to Win
To achieve the highest score:
1. **Collect larger orbs**: They give more points.
2. **Use the speed boost wisely**: Moving faster lets you collect more orbs, but you risk losing control.
3. **Stay precise**: Precision is key when collecting orbs, especially when speeding up.
4. **Beat the clock**: Time management is essential—get the most points before the 30-second timer runs out.

### Updates and Future Features
Future versions may include:
- Multiplayer mode
- Enhanced graphics
- New types of energy orbs with varying point values
- More dynamic control systems for greater challenge
